Welcome to my User Info Application

This application is for my interview at Precisely.

Requirements:

-Use spring boot MVC application to create an UI to enter the user's information like first name, last name, DOB etc.

-Store the info in a DB.

-Search the entered info in the search page.

-Search should display the info.

Execution:

I created an index page with a searchable table. I chose to display all user records by default and 
the search function would search the records in the table. 
Another option would be to create custom queries using elastic search. 
There is a nav bar on top which will bring you to a page where you can add users. 
If youâ€™d like to edit a user that has already been added, just click on the user id and it will bring you to the appropriate editing page. 
You can also delete users with the delete link in the delete column at the end of each row.
